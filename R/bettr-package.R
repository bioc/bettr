#' bettr: a better way to explore what is best
#' 
#' The bettr package provides a better way to explore what is best :)
#' Details about how to use the package can be found in the vignette. 
#' The main entry point is the `bettr()` function, which opens an 
#' interactive application for exploring data consisting of multiple 
#' parallel rankings of a set of entities (e.g., computational methods ranked 
#' by their performance based on several different metrics).
